{"id":"mars","name":"Mars","description":"Mars was the first system colonized by humans, and the most industrialized, with everything that comes with it. The planet was an early experiment at terraforming, turning it into a paradise- which was rapidly ruined once again as humans promptly brought and set up all of their industrial equipment. A mere two hundred years ago, it was devoid of water- now, it has far too much again. It is where the middle-class live, almost overwhelmingly. It is also a jumping-off-point to expeditions over the Asteroid Belt and Beyond.","locations":["planet","station","phobos","deimos"],"neighbors":["neptune","earth","venus","saturn","jupiter"]}
