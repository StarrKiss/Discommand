{"id":"pioneer","name":"UTF \"Pioneer\" Colonial Transport Flagship","description":"The Pioneer class flagship is an ancient ship, but it still finds its uses, even today. The ship is the only one of its kind, dating from a time before the colonization of the Sol system, and the expansion of the United Terran Federation. The Pioneer was built during the Second Space Race when the question turned from “Who can get there first?” to “Who can establish a permanent settlement there first?” The ship was had all its systems overhauled in 2102, and was decommissioned and sold in 2120. Pioneer now finds use as a passenger transport ship, usually ferrying passengers between Earth and the colony on Proxima Centauri B. Some more creative entrepreneurs now make quite the killing retrofitting the passenger section to carry cargo. Others even endeauvor to retrofit it into a drug ferrying ship- a task it is uniquely suited for due to the cracks and crevices of it's ancient machinery and innocuous appearance.","speed":90,"health":180,"cargospace":30,"dps":4.0}
