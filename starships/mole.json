{"id":"mole","name":"Union Corp M. O. L. E Heavy Mining Ship","description":"Perhaps as iconic as the pitch black of space itself is the bulky, dreadfully ugly MOLE, whose appearence brings to mind a dirty gray brick. The M.O.L.E's persistence is due to two things- People are lazy and don't want to spend money, and the fact that Union Corp has convinced people to spend exorbitant amounts of money on 'modernzing' their ancient MOLE ships in a process that is more expensive, and leads to a worse ship, than merely buying a new one. Yet, they remain a good, if clunky, option for any beginner miners.","speed":40,"health":250,"cargospace":15,"dps":1.0}
